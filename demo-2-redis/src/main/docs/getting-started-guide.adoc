= Introduction

RESTful persons is a RESTful web service for creating and storing persons. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.



[[getting_started_running_the_service]]
== Running the service
RESTful persons is written using https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd samples/rest-persons-spring-hateoas
$ ./gradlew build
$ java -jar build/libs/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

person the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.



[[getting_started_creating-a-person]]
== Creating an person
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new person. As you saw above, the URI for working with persones is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a person you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
payload containing the title and body of the person:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-person/1/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created person:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-person/1/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created person you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example
you can access the person's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-person/2/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the person's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-person/2/http-response.adoc[]
